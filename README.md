## ✨AI helped me with this project

I used generative AI in the form of LLMs to help me with this project.

- I used the AI to do simple styling, which I almost always touched up by hand
- I used the AI to generate code when I got stuck on individual problems or needed an approach for some features. I didn't copy-paste any code I didn't understand
- No images were created using AI
- No texts were created using AI
